Geospot, a location-based and human activity-based system for mobile advertisement and notification. Nowadays, the research and development environment around location-based services is hugely increasing, Geospot aims to be the starting point of an innovative way to explore these technologies. The ultimate idea of Geospot comes from the bright cohesion of the user location and the recognized activity (in terms of the kind of current movement) that the user is keeping. Thanks to the inertial sensors based Google API, in fact, it is possible to get an estimated user movement pattern. We combined these technologies to retrieve, over time and space, a set of zones identified by a point and a radius, in which, thanks to Google Geofence, the user is notified for targeted location-based advertisement or public utility information.
